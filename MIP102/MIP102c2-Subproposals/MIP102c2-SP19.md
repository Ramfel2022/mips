## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal seeks to make various updates to [MIP 113: Governance Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113). It is inspired by [Sovereign Finance AVC Q3 Aligned Scope Proposals Document](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Q3-Sovereign-Finance-AVC-Aligned-Scope-Proposals-Document-b30afb0b07d5467f877be31ba7598dd6).

### Amended MIPs and Components
