## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP107 Section 8.1, to include a strategy for the specifications of recoveries

### Amended MIPs and Components

- MIP 107 section 8
  - 8.1: Stablecoin Recovery

### MODIFICATIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

```
### 8.1: Stablecoin Recovery

#### 8.1.1

The strategy for returns should be based upon these factors:

* The minimum amount of DAI/NewStable to be eligible is 1000. This is a spam protection and would help to make the solution long-term cost efficient.
* A 7.5% fee for a successful return. This fee goes towards the technical development and to compensate MakerDAO for user mistakes.
* Returns should be carried out at the beginning of each quarter.
* Protocol Facilitators should determine a list of contracts and addresses that are eligibile for stuck DAI/NewStable return requests. Additions to this list can require a governance poll (tbd).
* Claimed DAI/NewStable will only be returned to the address where the transaction originated.
```
