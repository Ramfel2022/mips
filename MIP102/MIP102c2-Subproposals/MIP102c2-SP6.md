### Summary

Establish a policy to donate airdropped tokens to charitable causes. The [TBD] will make recommendations to the DAO on where to donate the funds, which will be voted on in the monthly governance cycle.

In the event that an airdropped token can be used to provide significant value to MakerDAO, TBD may propose that instead.

## Specification

[TBD]

### Motivation

MakerDAO has received various tokens through airdrops, many of which have sat unused as there is no consensus on what to do with them. Direct participation would add significant governance overhead to MakerDAO, and selling may be bad PR for MakerDAO. I propose using these tokens to contribute to MakerDAOs public good purpose by donating them to charitable causes.

This is a unique opportunity to support public goods, reduce governance overhead and boost MakerDAOs image without diluting MKR or touching the surplus buffer. Additionally, this can serve as a small-scale test-case for the Constitutions' Purpose System.
